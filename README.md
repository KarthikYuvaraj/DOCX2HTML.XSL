This project is aim to create perfect conversion from docx fileformat to html with XSLT stylesheet.

So far following features are supported:
- Pages (Page size, page orientation, forced page breaks, headers)
- Paragraphs, indents, paddings, 
- Lists (also nested list)
- Text styles: italic, underline, bold, color, font, background, kerning, alignment etc

The XSLT has been tested with Saxonce XSLT processor, but it should work with any XSLT 2.0 prosessor.
